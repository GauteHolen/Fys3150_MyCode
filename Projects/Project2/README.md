# How to run program
Run the main.py file. This file will compile the unit test program, run the unit tests, then compile the main.cpp program and run that.

After the main.py is run, the main.out program can be run directly. It has input arguments N, algorithm, p_max and w_r. 

The program will write results to a file in the folder results.
