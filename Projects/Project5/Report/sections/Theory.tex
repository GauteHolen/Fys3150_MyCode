\section{The SIRS model}
In short, the SIRS model is a model on an isolated population $N$, where each member of the population and be any of the three states:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $S$ Susceptible to the disease
    \item $I$ Infected with the disease
    \item $R$ Recovering from the disease with some temporary immunity
\end{enumerate}
The relationship between the different states are described by the following coupled differential equations
\begin{eqnarray}
    S' =c R-\frac{a S I}{N} \\
    I' =\frac{a S I}{N}-b I \\
    R' =b I-c R
\end{eqnarray}
Where $a$ is the infection rate, $b$ is the recovery rate and $c$ is the loss of immunity rate.
If N not time dependent,
$$
R = N - S - I
$$
So that
$$
S^{\prime} =c(N-S-I)-\frac{a S I}{N}
$$
$$
I^{\prime} =\frac{a S I}{N}-b I
$$
Otherwise
$$
N = I + R + S
$$
Needing $I$, $R$ and $S$ to calculate $N$, so then we need 3 coupled equations as $S$ depend on $N$, and $N$ depends on $S$ when N is time dependent.
By introducing birthrate $e$, natural deathrate $d$ and deathrate due to disease $d_I$, and assuming all newborns are susceptible and that everyone can randomly die from natural causes, we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
    S' =c R-\frac{a S I}{N} + eN -dS\\
    I' =\frac{a S I}{N}-b I -dI -d_I I\\
    R' =b I-c R -d R
\end{eqnarray}
Seasonal variations are introduced by modyfying the infection rate $a'$ (also referred to later as $a_{seasonal}$), such that
\begin{equation}
    a'=a+Acos(\omega t)
\end{equation}
Vaccinations are introduced with a vaccination rate $f$, causing a direct transition from $S$ to $R$, such that 
\begin{eqnarray}
    S^{\prime} &=c R-\frac{a S I}{N}-f \\
    I^{\prime} &=\frac{a S I}{N}-b I \\
    R^{\prime} &=b I-c R+f
\end{eqnarray}


Transitions between each state, are described by transiton probabilites
\begin{eqnarray}
        P (S \rightarrow I) \\
        P (I \rightarrow R) \\
        P (R \rightarrow I) 
\end{eqnarray}
Which may depend on which paramaters one might want to implement in a model.
The specific implementations will also vary depending on what method is used for solving or simulating the system.

If only $a$, $b$ and $c$ are considered, the expected values for the steady state of the system is given as, which is used to verify the simplest runs of the model
\begin{eqnarray}
    s^{*} &=\frac{b}{a} \\
    i^{*} &=\frac{1-\frac{b}{a}}{1+\frac{b}{c}} \\
    r^{*} &=\frac{b}{c} \frac{1-\frac{b}{a}}{1+\frac{b}{c}}
\end{eqnarray}
