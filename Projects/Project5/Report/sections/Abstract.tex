\section*{Abstract}
During december lockdown 2020, disease modeling is as relevant as ever, and to gain more insight into how disease behaves in an isolated population numerical models are developed.
A fourth order Runge-Kutta model, and a Monte Carlo simuation, both based on the same SIRS model are used to explore vital pramaters, seasonal varitains and vaccinatins effets on disease development.
The RK model is faster, while the MC simulation produces a greater variety of results which is considered closer to the unpredictable and random behaviour of a random system such as a disease in a population.
Infection death rate seems to cause previuosly stable populations of indected people in the population to disappear faster, seasonal variations cause more varied outcomes and scenarios, while vaccines prove very efficient at reducing deaths and infections, particularly if introduced early.
