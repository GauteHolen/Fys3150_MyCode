\section{Algorithms, implementation and testing}
As this project is new this year (as far as I know), some trial and error, as well as some creative freedom to change equations for more realistic implementation was taken.



\subsection{Runge-Kutta model}


When the population is stable, such that $N$ is constant, we have that
\begin{equation}
    N=I+R+S
\end{equation}
Which can be simplified such that
$$
R=N-R-S
$$
So that $R$ is plugged into the equation for $S$, and we only need 2 equations. 
However, as is the case with the vital parameters where N is changing, we now have to update N and R, which depend on each other, 
which is no longer possible. This version of the RK-model turns out to be signifficantly slowe, as both N and R now needs to be calculated for every step.
